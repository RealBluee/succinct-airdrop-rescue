# üõ°Ô∏è Succinct Airdrop Atomic Rescue Tool

A secure solution to claim tokens from a compromised wallet using Flashbots MEV protection. This tool enables atomic claiming and transfer of Succinct Foundation airdrop tokens, preventing frontrunning attacks.

## üö® The Problem

Your wallet is compromised (private key potentially exposed), but it contains unclaimed airdrop tokens. Traditional claiming methods risk immediate theft by MEV bots or attackers monitoring the mempool.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

This tool uses **Flashbots bundles** to execute both claiming and transfer transactions atomically in a single block, ensuring no one can intercept your tokens between claim and transfer.

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Authentication Phase
- Requests nonce from Succinct claim API
- Signs SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum) message
- Obtains JWT authentication token

### 2. Claim Data Retrieval
- Fetches your eligibility proof from the API
- Gets claim index, token amount, and Merkle proof

### 3. Atomic Execution
- **Transaction 1**: Claims tokens to compromised wallet
- **Transaction 2**: Immediately transfers tokens to safe wallet
- Both execute in the same block or fail together

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm
- Alchemy/Infura RPC endpoints
- Compromised wallet private key
- Sponsor wallet with ETH for gas fees

### Environment Variables
```bash
COMPROMISED_KEY=your_compromised_private_key
SPONSOR_KEY=your_sponsor_private_key  
NEW_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_new_safe_address
ALCHEMY_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-API-KEY
INFURA_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID
```

### Installation
```bash
npm install ethers @flashbots/ethers-provider-bundle axios dotenv
node succinct-claim.js
```

## üîí Security Features

- **‚úÖ Atomic Execution**: Both transactions succeed together or fail together
- **‚úÖ MEV Protection**: Uses Flashbots private mempool
- **‚úÖ Frontrun Prevention**: Transactions invisible until execution
- **‚úÖ Multiple RPC Fallback**: Redundant network connectivity

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **Gas Requirements**: Sponsor wallet needs sufficient ETH
- **One Opportunity**: Most airdrops allow single claim attempts
- **Timing Sensitive**: Target block must be current for inclusion
- **Test First**: Verify on testnet if possible

## üéØ Use Cases

Perfect for rescuing tokens from wallets that may be:
- Compromised by malware
- Exposed through phishing
- Shared accidentally
- At risk of private key exposure

## üìä Success Rate

The atomic bundle approach provides near-100% success rate when:
- Sufficient gas fees are provided
- Network conditions are stable
- Claim eligibility is verified
